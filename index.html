                    <details>
                        <summary>
                            From locked windows to courtroom letters, I forged
                            independence, discipline, and a hunger to learn
                            through early adversity.

                        </summary>
                        <p>
                            Starting from humble beginnings, I spent my early
                            childhood deeply fascinated by science, watching
                            Netflix documentaries and building complex LEGO
                            models without instructions. This natural curiosity
                            became my anchor during a very difficult period of
                            my life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My upbringing was marked by extreme isolation. My
                            mother struggled with serious fears and mental
                            health issues that manifested in restrictive and
                            isolating behavior. Communication with the outside
                            world was nearly impossible. Even the sunlight in my
                            room was blocked by hurricane shutters due to her
                            intense fear of ‚Äúpredators.‚Äù Technology, books, and
                            basic freedoms were all tightly controlled.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was left without consistent schooling or support.
                            At one point, I had to draft responses for court
                            cases and communicate with legal representatives.
                            These experiences forced me to quickly develop
                            social and emotional skills, just to advocate for
                            myself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The environment had a heavy toll on my physical and
                            mental health, there was no space for exercise,
                            little sunlight, and unhealthy food. My academic
                            performance suffered. My mother actively discouraged
                            education, even suggesting I fail on purpose to stay
                            with younger children. She delayed my enrollment and
                            failed to provide a working homeschool curriculum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this chaos, I taught myself how to study. I
                            managed my assignments alone. I also learned hard
                            truths about how trust can be manipulated. In one
                            incident, when bills went unpaid, my mother
                            pressured me to write a letter claiming emotional
                            attachment to our apartment so we wouldn‚Äôt be
                            evicted, using my words as a legal tool to avoid
                            responsibility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These constant stressors, barely scratching the
                            surface, built my core traits: resilience, mental
                            endurance, and deep self-awareness. I found ways to
                            grow despite being cut off from the world,
                            especially in the field of technology, which she
                            disapproved of because it represented a future I
                            wanted for myself, one that resembled my father‚Äôs
                            path, not hers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the Covid pandemic, her behavior became more
                            severe. I realized I couldn‚Äôt survive in that
                            environment any longer. I faced enormous fear but
                            found the courage to reach out for help. After more
                            than a year of legal battles and emotional hardship,
                            I was finally placed under the custody of my father.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That was the turning point. I knew I had lost time.
                            I didn‚Äôt wait, I pushed myself into rapid learning
                            and hard work to catch up to the herd in the
                            academic rat race. It was a chaotic start, but I
                            believe I showed incredible maturity by guiding
                            myself through it all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also developed a deep imagination and creativity.
                            In a world darkened by fear, I built my own light,
                            one idea at a time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During this deeply challenging period in my life, I
                            had to learn to navigate the unpredictable behavior
                            of my mother‚Äîshe had sole custody of me, at the
                            time, struggling with severe mental health issues. I
                            developed skills in de-escalation, emotional
                            regulation, and boundary-setting, all while
                            safeguarding my own stability and pursuing my goals.
                            I managed crisis situations, including threats of
                            self-harm and institutionalization, with calm and
                            strategy, learning to stay grounded despite fear and
                            pressure. This experience strengthened my empathy,
                            resilience, and ability to work under high emotional
                            stress.

                        <summary>
                            After moving in with my father, I jumped headfirst
                            into rapid self-learning, programming, club
                            creation, and community leadership.

                        <p>
                            With full access to a computer and the internet, I
                            began teaching myself programming, starting with
                            game development. I published several games,
                            including a multiplayer VR project, all without
                            formal instruction or AI tools. I took this action
                            because I recognized the need for a future career,
                            and consolidating my skills early on would be
                            beneficial later.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the same time, I was involved in a legal battle
                            with my mother. As a minor, I had to carefully
                            communicate my will through a court guardian,
                            navigating intense pressure while protecting my
                            autonomy. As she viewed me as a disgruntled child of
                            whom it was her will to use to her liking. I had to
                            navigate around her advantage to speak directly in
                            court and directly manipulate the story behide my
                            back.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I turned around years of poor academic performance,
                            drastically improving my grades and writing skills.
                            I knew even small mistakes could be used against me
                            ‚Äîin the family court house, so I became hyper-aware
                            and intentional in everything I did.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also transformed physically through daily jogging
                            and sports with my dad, and socially, by forming
                            friendships that still last today. This period
                            shaped my foundation, the era before high school
                            that built who I am now.

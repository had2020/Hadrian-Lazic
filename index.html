                    <details>
                        <summary>
                            From locked windows to courtroom letters, I forged
                            independence, discipline, and a hunger to learn
                            through early adversity.

                        </summary>
                        <p>
                            Starting from humble beginnings, I spent my early
                            childhood deeply fascinated by science, watching
                            Netflix documentaries and building complex LEGO
                            models without instructions. This natural curiosity
                            became my anchor during a very difficult period of
                            my life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My upbringing was marked by extreme isolation. My
                            mother struggled with serious fears and mental
                            health issues that manifested in restrictive and
                            isolating behavior. Communication with the outside
                            world was nearly impossible. Even the sunlight in my
                            room was blocked by hurricane shutters due to her
                            intense fear of ‚Äúpredators.‚Äù Technology, books, and
                            basic freedoms were all tightly controlled.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was left without consistent schooling or support.
                            At one point, I had to draft responses for court
                            cases and communicate with legal representatives.
                            These experiences forced me to quickly develop
                            social and emotional skills, just to advocate for
                            myself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The environment had a heavy toll on my physical and
                            mental health, there was no space for exercise,
                            little sunlight, and unhealthy food. My academic
                            performance suffered. My mother actively discouraged
                            education, even suggesting I fail on purpose to stay
                            with younger children. She delayed my enrollment and
                            failed to provide a working homeschool curriculum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this chaos, I taught myself how to study. I
                            managed my assignments alone. I also learned hard
                            truths about how trust can be manipulated. In one
                            incident, when bills went unpaid, my mother
                            pressured me to write a letter claiming emotional
                            attachment to our apartment so we wouldn‚Äôt be
                            evicted, using my words as a legal tool to avoid
                            responsibility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These constant stressors, barely scratching the
                            surface, built my core traits: resilience, mental
                            endurance, and deep self-awareness. I found ways to
                            grow despite being cut off from the world,
                            especially in the field of technology, which she
                            disapproved of because it represented a future I
                            wanted for myself, one that resembled my father‚Äôs
                            path, not hers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the Covid pandemic, her behavior became more
                            severe. I realized I couldn‚Äôt survive in that
                            environment any longer. I faced enormous fear but
                            found the courage to reach out for help. After more
                            than a year of legal battles and emotional hardship,
                            I was finally placed under the custody of my father.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That was the turning point. I knew I had lost time.
                            I didn‚Äôt wait, I pushed myself into rapid learning
                            and hard work to catch up to the herd in the
                            academic rat race. It was a chaotic start, but I
                            believe I showed incredible maturity by guiding
                            myself through it all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also developed a deep imagination and creativity.
                            In a world darkened by fear, I built my own light,
                            one idea at a time.

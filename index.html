                        <summary>
                            From locked windows to courtroom letters, I forged
                            independence, discipline, and a hunger to learn
                            through early adversity.

                        <p>
                            Starting from humble beginnings, I spent my early
                            childhood deeply fascinated by science, watching
                            Netflix documentaries and building complex Lego
                            starships without instructions. This natural
                            curiosity became my anchor during a very difficult
                            period of my life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My upbringing was marked by extreme isolation. My
                            mother struggled with serious fears and mental
                            health issues that manifested in restrictive and
                            isolating behavior. Communication with the outside
                            world was nearly impossible. Even the sunlight in my
                            room was blocked by hurricane shutters due to her
                            intense fear of ‚Äúpredators.‚Äù Technology, books, and
                            basic freedoms were all tightly controlled.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was left without consistent schooling or support.
                            At one point, I had to draft responses for court
                            cases and communicate with legal representatives.
                            These experiences forced me to quickly develop
                            social and emotional skills, just to advocate for
                            myself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The environment had a heavy toll on my physical and
                            mental health, there was no space for exercise,
                            little sunlight, and unhealthy food. My academic
                            performance suffered. My mother actively discouraged
                            education, even suggesting I fail on purpose to stay
                            with younger children. She delayed my enrollment and
                            failed to provide a working homeschool curriculum.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In this chaos, I taught myself how to study. I
                            managed my assignments alone. I also learned hard
                            truths about how trust can be manipulated. In one
                            incident, when bills went unpaid, my mother
                            pressured me to write a letter claiming emotional
                            attachment to our apartment so we wouldn‚Äôt be
                            evicted, using my words as a legal tool to avoid
                            responsibility.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These constant stressors, barely scratching the
                            surface, built my core traits: resilience, mental
                            endurance, and deep self-awareness. I found ways to
                            grow despite being cut off from the world,
                            especially in the field of technology, which she
                            disapproved of because it represented a future I
                            wanted for myself, one that resembled my father‚Äôs
                            path, not hers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During the Covid pandemic, her behavior became more
                            severe. I realized I couldn‚Äôt survive in that
                            environment any longer. I faced enormous fear but
                            found the courage to reach out for help. After more
                            than a year of legal battles and emotional hardship,
                            I was finally placed under the custody of my father.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That was the turning point. I knew I had lost time.
                            I didn‚Äôt wait, I pushed myself into rapid learning
                            and hard work to catch up to the herd in the
                            academic rat race. It was a chaotic start, but I
                            believe I showed incredible maturity by guiding
                            myself through it all.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also developed a deep imagination and creativity.
                            In a world darkened by fear, I built my own light,
                            one idea at a time.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During this deeply challenging period in my life, I
                            had to learn to navigate the unpredictable behavior
                            of my mother‚Äîshe had sole custody of me, at the
                            time, struggling with severe mental health issues. I
                            developed skills in de-escalation, emotional
                            regulation, and boundary-setting, all while
                            safeguarding my own stability and pursuing my goals.
                            I managed crisis situations, including threats of
                            self-harm and institutionalization, with calm and
                            strategy, learning to stay grounded despite fear and
                            pressure. This experience strengthened my empathy,
                            resilience, and ability to work under high emotional
                            stress.

                            After moving in with my father, I jumped headfirst
                            into rapid self-learning, programming, club
                            creation, and community leadership.

                        <p>
                            With full access to a computer and the internet, I
                            began teaching myself programming, starting with
                            game development. I published several games,
                            including a multiplayer VR project, all without
                            formal instruction or AI tools. I took this action
                            because I recognized the need for a future career,
                            and consolidating my skills early on would be
                            beneficial later.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the same time, I was involved in a legal battle
                            with my mother. As a minor, I had to carefully
                            communicate my will through a court guardian,
                            navigating intense pressure while protecting my
                            autonomy. As she viewed me as a disgruntled child of
                            whom it was her will to use to her liking. I had to
                            navigate around her advantage to speak directly in
                            court and directly manipulate the story behide my
                            back.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I turned around years of poor academic performance,
                            drastically improving my grades and writing skills.
                            I knew even small mistakes could be used against me
                            ‚Äîin the family court house, so I became hyper-aware
                            and intentional in everything I did.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Also within this time, I created a Youtube channel
                            with fully and professionally edited videos, of
                            computer hardware, software support, game reviews,
                            getting about 1,000 views on a video.

                            I also transformed physically through daily jogging
                            and sports with my dad, and socially, by forming
                            friendships that still last today. This period
                            shaped my foundation, the era before high school
                            that built who I am now.

                            decentralized networking system from scratch to
                            handle player sessions. I also engineered a
                            physics-based full-body VR system, all within one of
                            the most advanced and graphically demanding engines
                            in the industry. This project marked my transition
                            from simple Unity-based games to more serious and
                            technically ambitious software development.

                            At the same time, I switched to Linux, an operating

                            users, and learned to navigate and master its

                            me grow both intellectually and personally. I also
                            honed my writing skills, taking pride in finally
                            mastering grammar basics (yes, I earned those commas

                            Outside the classroom, I stayed active year-round
                            with sports. Cross-country became my favorite, but I
                            also competed in track, basketball, and wrestling,
                            learning discipline, endurance, and teamwork along

                            game development, it wasn‚Äôt where I wanted to stop.
                            I craved deeper challenges. So I pivoted toward
                            Python, web development, and backend engineering. I
                            learned HTML and CSS and used those skills to build
                            the very site you‚Äôre reading right now. I also
                            learned to manage remote Linux servers in headless
                            (no graphical interface) environments, an essential
                            skill for deploying full-stack websites and running
                            powerful backend systems used by real clients.

                        <p>
                            By the end of sophomore year, I looked back at the
                            strong programming foundation I had built, and came
                            to a surprising realization: game development, while
                            fun, wasn‚Äôt the long-term path I wanted. I needed
                            more room to grow, solve harder problems, and build
                            tools that had a real-world impact. So, I pivoted
                            into Python programming and began learning HTML and
                            CSS, which allowed me to build the very website
                            you're viewing now.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the same time, I taught myself how to manage
                            Linux servers remotely, without any graphical
                            interface, working purely through the terminal. This
                            advanced skill is essential for real-world software
                            development, where headless servers power everything
                            from web apps to complex databases. It‚Äôs one of the
                            toughest but most critical capabilities in backend
                            infrastructure, and I was determined to master it.

                            meaningfully to a team, I had already spent weeks
                            before leveling up in Python Flask, a powerful web
                            framework that let me build real, database-driven
                            websites with interactive frontends and scalable

                            students who claimed to have similar skills, but I
                            quickly realized I‚Äôd be the one leading the charge.
                            In only two days, I built a full-stack, client-ready
                            website that included features like a saved chat
                            room, a discussion board, and user accounts
                            connected to a SQL database. I also took on the role
                            of teacher, guiding my teammates through HTML and
                            CSS while pulling long hours during lunch and late
                            into the night to ensure we had something real to
                            present.

                            In the end, our project stood out. A college
                            freshman even complimented me, saying my project
                            looked like a real professional product, especially

                            produced by most others in our age group. That
                            moment hit hard: I realized I was not only capable,
                            but that my skills could help others. That weekend
                            lit a fire in me, and made it clear that software

                            measured the broken disk, cut a new one from a food
                            tray, embedded fridge magnets into it, and used
                            super glue and duct tape to attach it. I mounted the
                            pedal and gave it a spin, and to both my and my
                            dad‚Äôs shock, the motor roared back to life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I was so excited, I let it get to my head and
                            jokingly called him a buffoon for not believing me.
                            Since then, I‚Äôve learned to manage my enthusiasm
                            with humility, because building cool things is only
                            part of the mission. Bringing people along and
                            staying grounded matters just as much.

                        <p>
                            Sadly during the later parts of freshman year my
                            body had developed some sort of Autoimmune issues
                            within many organs, with a complexity beyond the
                            current scope of our medical science. I had to go to
                            doctors and explain all my symptoms and get many
                            checks. Many times I found my Autoimmune could not
                            fit into any category.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The cause of this Autoimmune is beyond me, even with
                            tons of research I can only say it has possible
                            something to do with all the stress I felt in my
                            past, and or Covid, because my body would seemly
                            develop new types of allergic reactions whenever I
                            got covid, and I would get very sick for many weeks,
                            I would also catch covid count at least twelve more
                            times. I would have to research how to prevent and
                            deal with these horrible allergic reactions, some
                            that made the teachers think I had some biblical
                            disease.

                        <p>
                            I had to manage my diet trying to carefully pinpoint
                            which foods were killing me slowly, as some were
                            causing damage to my guts and lead to me getting
                            I.B.S. I had to deal with many life threatening
                            moments that I had to prepare for and correctly
                            handle, and endure the immense pain, as not doing
                            such would lead to my death. These near death
                            experiences and medical experiences furthered my
                            understanding of my state of health and the medical

                            research and no help from my doctor who just said
                            wait it out, and did not take me seriously due to my
                            youth, I know take proper herbs, vietnams, and

                            foods that I was very allergic too suddenly. As a
                            direct result of solely my actions I still stand on

                            In my free time, I developed a deep interest in
                            biology and sustainable gardening, partly to support
                            my health, and partly out of pure fascination with
                            how living systems work. With limited space on our
                            apartment patio, I designed and built DIY vertical
                            farming setups, complete with custom water-routing
                            systems and an indoor hydroponics station.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Under my dad‚Äôs supervision, I‚Äôve grown and cooked
                            meals from my harvests. Some of my favorites include
                            baked potatoes from our own batch of spuds and
                            nutrient-rich greens like watercress and Malabar
                            spinach, grown in a soil-free setup. I also created
                            a natural pest management system by integrating
                            mint, which keeps the crops healthy without
                            chemicals.

                        <p>
                            As my interest expanded, so did the variety of
                            plants: I added Upland Cress, Aqua Large Leaf
                            Watercress, Green Giant Malabar Spinach, radishes,
                            and even Biker Billy F1 hybrid hot peppers, creating
                            complete, home-grown meals. For Father‚Äôs Day, I
                            surprised my dad by fitting a lemon tree into our
                            already-tight patio system. He didn‚Äôt believe it
                            could fit, but with some creative thinking and
                            re-engineering of the water flow system, I made it
                            work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I became fascinated with plant propagation,
                            especially how certain species can be cloned from
                            cuttings. That led me to experiment with succulents
                            like jade trees and to explore how plants adapt to
                            pollution and changing environments.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My curiosity didn‚Äôt stop with plants, I dove into
                            fungi as well. I built specialized mushroom habitats
                            in large indoor boxes using softwood chips and
                            filtered airflow. I successfully grow oyster
                            mushrooms, lion‚Äôs mane, and a third variety I can't
                            quite remember the name of. Watching the mushroom
                            fruit was incredible, and cooking and eating them
                            with my dad made it even more rewarding. Along the
                            way, I had to bust a few mushroom myths my dad (and
                            even some adults!) had picked up.

                            In total, I‚Äôve spent hundreds of hours reading about
                            biology, watching science content, and chatting with
                            ChatGPT to better understand the relationship
                            between nutrition, sustainable food systems, and
                            health. Gardening has taught me about resilience,
                            observation, patience, and the science that connects
                            us to the natural world, and it's deeply improved my
                            own well-being along the way.

                            In my junior year, I decided to take my programming
                            skills even further by diving into Machine Learning,
                            not just because it‚Äôs a hot field, but because I was
                            deeply frustrated by the direction AI development
                            was heading.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I noticed that most current AI models, including
                            popular tools like ChatGPT, were being trained in
                            environments fundamentally disconnected from what it
                            would take to reach Artificial General Intelligence
                            (AGI).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To me, it seemed obvious: if we want to replicate
                            human-level intelligence, we need to train AI in a
                            complex, dynamic universe, one that mimics the full
                            context in which humanity evolved. This idea isn‚Äôt
                            new in theory, but I felt it wasn‚Äôt being applied
                            seriously enough in practice.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            That realization pushed me to stop just watching the
                            field and start contributing to it. I began studying
                            machine learning fundamentals and built several
                            small projects to understand how models actually
                            learn, from input data to weights, layers, and
                            inference. My goal is to eventually contribute to
                            more advanced systems that reflect the kind of
                            embodied, social, and persistent learning that AGI
                            would realistically require, perhaps even through a
                            simulated metaverse filled with autonomous AIs
                            interacting like a society.

                            beginner-friendly app framework that supported
                            buttons, text elements, editable fields, resizable
                            windows, and more.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It was designed to help new Rust programmers build
                            real applications easily, with features that were
                            unheard of in any other Rust GUI toolset at the
                            time. Once the framework was stable, I shared it on
                            Reddit, and the response exploded.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The post received over 36,000 views, and my
                            framework was downloaded more than 10,000 times. I
                            suddenly found myself maintaining a live open-source
                            project being used by thousands of developers,
                            managing security, answering questions, and writing
                            documentation that helped complete beginners learn
                            to build apps in Rust.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Maintaining the project in real time taught me more
                            than just coding, it taught me how to support a
                            developer community, write clear documentation, and
                            think about the long-term stability of tools that
                            others rely on. Even now, developers continue to
                            download and use the framework, and I continue to
                            update it, improve it, and support those learning
                            through it.

                            During winter break, I had extra time to reflect,
                            and to build. I realized my dad still associated my
                            programming skills with my earlier game projects
                            from middle school.

                            Back then, I had tried to build a stock price

                            working. It stuck with me. Now, years later, the

                            days.

                        <p>
                            Later in junior year, I decided to tackle one of my
                            most technically ambitious projects yet: building a
                            web browser that runs entirely inside the terminal.
                            To do that, I also needed a new Terminal GUI
                            framework, so I built that too, both projects
                            written entirely in Rust.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            In just a few days, I released both the terminal
                            browser and the framework. The framework received
                            around 600 downloads, and it represents a milestone
                            for me I‚Äôve reached the point where I can publish
                            functional, creative Rust frameworks from scratch
                            within days. There's no going back now, this is the
                            skill ceiling where things get serious. And it‚Äôs
                            only the beginning of what I can build when I focus.

                        <p>
                            With everything I‚Äôd learned by the end of junior
                            year, I finally felt ready to take on a challenge
                            that had been bothering me for a long time: the core
                            flaws in how the AI field approaches Machine
                            Learning. I wanted to build something that wasn‚Äôt
                            just a project, but a framework. Something that
                            could scale, teach, and evolve.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So I planned my project carefully, defining the
                            problem I wanted to solve. Then I built a scalable
                            foundation, and committed to doing it the hard way:
                            using pure Rust, with no external ML libraries.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I dove deep into the mathematics behind machine
                            learning, cycling through intense research sessions
                            and back-and-forth conversations with ChatGPT,
                            breaking down calculus-heavy formulas and abstract
                            ML concepts into something I could understand and
                            re-implement manually. Over time, I built a full
                            base for my own ML framework, one that didn‚Äôt just
                            copy existing systems, but helped me understand them
                            on a fundamental level.

                            I dove deep into the mathematics behind machine

                        <p>
                            Once the core was in place, I created the
                            framework‚Äôs first advanced model: an image
                            classifier trained on a dataset I assembled myself.
                            This wasn‚Äôt a toy project, it was a
                            professional-grade proof of concept showing that the
                            framework could handle real data and real learning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After optimizing performance and adding more ML
                            features, I decided to shift my focus back toward
                            accessibility. I began building my own Keras-style
                            API, a tool that allows users to define complex
                            neural networks in just a few lines of code, hiding
                            the difficult math behind a friendly interface.
                            Creating this kind of abstraction, compressing
                            hundreds of lines of math-intensive code into
                            something beginner-friendly, was one of the hardest
                            things I‚Äôve ever done.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As my machine learning framework grew more complex,
                            so did the comments I left in my code. What started
                            as simple notes evolved into paragraphs of deep
                            technical explanations, filled with diagrams,
                            derivations, and reflections. Eventually, I
                            realized, I wasn't just building a framework
                            anymore. I was writing a research
                            paper‚Äîforeshadowing.

                            HTML and CSS graphics. That combo of an assignment
                            and a website, let me focus on school work and my

                            the website still remains up. Another time, for my

                        <p>
                            Earlier in my junior year, I decided to start a
                            coding club at school. By that point, I had
                            accumulated enough experience in computer science to
                            want to share it, and I saw it as the perfect
                            opportunity to practice leadership and inspire
                            others.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At first, I assumed one of the two other programmers
                            in the school would join me, but one transferred
                            schools and the other never showed up. So I found
                            myself leading a group of ten students, most of whom
                            had never written a line of code, and all of whom
                            were working with restricted school Chromebooks.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I tried assigning teaching roles to a few friends,
                            but most were overwhelmed by the difficulty and
                            short on time between classes. Eventually, the group
                            settled into a tighter core of five members, which I
                            could manage much more effectively. I adapted my
                            teaching style, focusing on fundamentals, hands-on
                            practice, and most importantly, confidence-building.
                            Over time, I was able to ignite a spark in several
                            students.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One member, now learning C++, began documenting his
                            projects on GitHub to strengthen his college
                            application, after I showed him how to self-learn
                            and version control his work.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another student picked up Python for his college
                            physics math in the future.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            More recently, a new member found excitement in
                            front-end web development, and I‚Äôve started teaching
                            him how to build real websites.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most of them started with no experience, only
                            school-issued Chromebooks, and very little time.
                            Yet, by the end of the semester, they all understood
                            the basics of programming, and a few had started
                            learning independently, creating a cycle of
                            self-growth I‚Äôm incredibly proud of. One of my
                            favorite moments came when a student showed me a C++
                            calculator he built to solve some tricky math
                            homework on IXL, just like one of my first coding
                            projects. Seeing that was more than just rewarding,
                            it was heartwarming.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To this day, I still mentor the group and run the
                            club bi-weekly, helping new coders take their first
                            steps, just like I once did.

                        <summary>
                            Recently, I had a school assignment that involved
                            running an environmental awareness campaign. If
                            you‚Äôre a teacher reading this, you probably know the
                            one.

                        </summary>
                        <p>
                            While researching, I stumbled upon particulate
                            matter, a dangerous form of air pollution made up of
                            microscopic particles, mostly from diesel engines,
                            that quietly damages your lungs. I was surprised I'd
                            never heard of it before, and I knew most of my
                            classmates hadn‚Äôt either. That made it the perfect
                            topic.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Instead of making a typical poster, I decided to
                            launch a full-blown campaign. I designed and printed
                            giant QR codes linked to a game I built in just
                            three days using my latest programming and game
                            design skills. The game was funny, fast-paced, and
                            had a short environmental lesson at the end. I
                            paired the QR codes with memes and humor to grab
                            attention, and distributed them both physically and
                            digitally across the school in a single day.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The campaign blew up. Students started scanning the
                            codes, playing the game, and even copying my idea
                            for their own projects. But there were challenges
                            too, some students, thanks to my ‚Äúhacker‚Äù vibe,
                            assumed the game was a computer virus, which taught
                            me a lot about user psychology and how people
                            respond to unfamiliar tech in real life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Behind the scenes, I also had to deal with team
                            dynamics. One of my original teammates, a close
                            friend, dismissed my work as ‚Äúa cry for help‚Äù and
                            thought I was taking the project, and its attached
                            $1,000 prize and certificate, too seriously.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            They procrastinated constantly and left critical
                            writing tasks unfinished. As much as it hurt, I made
                            the difficult call to replace them with another
                            student who was more focused and contributed
                            significantly to the final submission. This
                            experience taught me so much more than just
                            environmental science or game dev.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I learned how to market a message, manage a team,
                            and most importantly, when to make tough leadership
                            decisions, even when emotions are involved. I also
                            got to see how creativity, tech, and humor can
                            spread a real-world idea faster than any lecture
                            ever could.

                    <h3>üìú ML Research paper</h3>
                    <details>
                        <summary>
                            I decided to write an academic research paper that
                            aims to do what no other does teach machine learning
                            without heavy calculus.

                            >
                        </summary>
                        <p>
                            But this wouldn‚Äôt be a traditional academic paper
                            filled with dense formulas only accessible to
                            students in advanced college calculus. I wanted to
                            create something that people like me, self-taught,
                            curious, and still in high school, could actually
                            understand and use.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            So I spent alot of my coding time doing something
                            new researching, organizing, and writing. I
                            developed a teaching system I call ‚ÄúFormulaic Code,‚Äù
                            which replaces abstract mathematical notation with
                            clear, structured pseudocode and plain-language
                            explanations. I broke down the most important
                            machine learning concepts, like backpropagation,
                            loss functions, and activation curves, into
                            digestible ideas, complete with graphs, visuals, and
                            clean code samples.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The final paper totaled 66 pages. It documents
                            everything I learned while building my machine
                            learning framework in Rust, and it serves as a
                            bridge between advanced academic ML and beginners
                            who want to understand how it really works.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I published it on Preprints.org, and within just
                            four days, it received 43 downloads, along with
                            messages of support and encouragement from readers,
                            some of whom saw themselves in the challenges I‚Äôd
                            faced. Writing the paper also taught me how to level
                            up my academic writing and gave me my first glimpse
                            into the world of scientific publishing.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the heart of this project is one belief: machine
                            learning shouldn't be locked behind inaccessible
                            math or exclusive institutions. If I can help more
                            students chase their dreams, regardless of
                            background or classroom, then this paper has already
                            done its job.

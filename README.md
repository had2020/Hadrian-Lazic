welcome to my personal portfolio website.

# Usage
currently I use at as more of a brag sheet for recommandation letters. My teachers can scan the QR code that I can show them, which will lead them to my website. Within they can also add themselves to an email anor phone list of mine to remind them, when I need their letters. Later on in my carrerr I will most likely convert this repo/github pages website into a online portfolio website.

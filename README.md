# Hadrian-Lazic
Hi, my name is Hadrian Lazic!
Welcome to my personal portfolio website. 

# Usage
Currently, I use my website as a central hub for recommendation letters. My teachers can scan a QR code I provide, which directs them to the site. There, they can also add themselves to my email and phone list to receive reminders when I need their letters. Later in my career, I will most likely convert this repository/GitHub Pages website into an online portfolio.
